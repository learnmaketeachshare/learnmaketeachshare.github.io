For me the phrase “Learn Make Teach Share” represents both an ethical approach and
a practice that helps weave more curiosity and kindness into our interactions
with each other.

I greatly enjoy making all sorts of things both beautiful and utilitarian but
my favorite experiences have come from helping to create/inspire that deep full-body
smile people get when they figure out something they never knew they could do
before.

I believe those ripples of curiosity and joy make self-reinforcing waves that can help
make the world more wonderful.

Some simple everyday goals:

- Learn something new.
- Make something that entertains you or does something useful ... or both!
- Share this with people you meet!
- Help other folks learn how to do it.
