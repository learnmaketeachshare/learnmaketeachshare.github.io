Forest Voges and I have been hosting community Shiitake Inoculation parties every Fall
and Spring for the last few years. We usually hold them behind Forest's house at
206 Cooleyville Rd,Shutesbury, MA 01072.

Forest and I supply materials, tools, and some assembly line to help
the work move smoothly. We also have been cutting and collecting logs for inocolulation.

Forest's Landrover is filled with Red Oak after collecting logs we cut in the woods.

Folks are very welcome to join us and learn about inoculation and to take home some logs.

If you want to bring logs to inoculate and share that's fantastic!

If you have trees that would make good Shiitake or Oyster logs and need help cutting and
moving them just let me know. We can help!

The cash outlay usually runs between $90-120 and we encourage people to contribute what
they can and what feels fair.

The first one was Nov 12, 2016 -- just after the presidential election. I think everybody
enjoying doing something optimistic together.

We usually start around 10-11, have a pot luck lunch around 1, and finish around 3-4.

### Good logs for growing Shiitakes and when to cut them.

White Oak seems to be one of the very best trees for growing Shiitakes,
Red Oak is fine also. We've also grown them on Red Maple and Beech.

Shiitakes always seem happy on White Oak.

See this species selection table: https://www.fieldforest.net/pdfs/Tree%20Species%20Chart.pdf

It's important to use trees that have a great deal of stored food energy. It's this stored
food energy that the mushroom mycelium processes and uses to fruit mushrooms intermittently.

Deciduous trees have the least food energy in the late Spring and early summer. They have used up
a bunch of energy creating and growing lots of green leaves and it's these leaves which are
creating energy for the tree the rest of the sumer and into the Fall. When the leaves have
turned color in the Fall the tree is no longer making and storing more food energy. This is a great
time to cut trees for mushroom inoculation. Around here that is usually in mid to late October.

Mushroom logs need to be moved around and re-positioned occasionally so it's helpful to make
sure they aren't too big and end up annoyingly heavy. A good size to cut are logs with
diameters from 3-6 inches and lengths from 28 to 36-40 inches. This usually means that a tree
that is 8 inches in diameter at the base is terrific.

After cutting, the logs need to rest for two or three weeks before inoculation. A healthy tree
has anti-fungal properties and it important to let these properties dissapate before introducing
the mushroom mycelium we want to grow in the log.

After cutting the logs should be placed in low stacks off the ground and protected from
drying out excessively. If they end up stacked where it's sunny cover them with something
when it's not rainy to lessen the tendency to dry out.

Another good time to cut logs is in the early Spring before the buds swell. Around
here that usually means in March. As this point the tree still hasn't used much of the
food energy stored last season.

### Good logs for growing Oysters.

Oyster mushrooms like to grow on some of the softer hardwoods.
Any of these species should work well:

1. Bigtooth Aspen (Populus grandidentata)
2. Trembling Aspen (Populus tremuloides)
3. Cottonwood (P. deltoides and other spp.)
4. Balsam Poplar (P. balsamifera and other spp.)
5. Basswood
6. Hackberry and Mulberry
7. Willows (Salix spp.)
8. Tulip or Yellow Poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera)

### After inoculation it usually takes about a year before before first fruiting.

After inoculation the logs will usually need a full growing season before the first fruiting.
Mycelium grows best when the weather is warmer and the logs stay relatively moist.

During this initial period keep the logs in low stacks just off the ground and someplace where
they get little direct sunlight.

1. Low stacks close to the ground help keep the logs moister because the microclimate next to the ground is a bit more humid.
2. Once established if the log drys out the mycelium won't die -- it will just stop growing. You'll get mushrooms sooner if thelogs are kept relatively moist.

If you inoculated in the Fall or Spring and the summer has been warm and there were regular
soaking rains it's reasonable to expect a first fruiting to happen in the Fall. When you think
the logs might be getting ready to fruit stand them up and lean them against a tree or fence.
There are two problems to be aware of if the mushrooms start to fruit while the logs are
in a low stack.

Shiitake mycelium will still grow throughout a log even if other fungi are also colonizing
the log however it's good to avoid introducing other fungi.

1. You might not see them if they start growing on the bottoim of the log.
2. Some will end up growing into the side of the log next in the stack and end up mishapen.

It will be both easier to see and pick mushrooms that are fruiting when thelogs are in a
close to vertical lean.

I've started placing flat rocks around the trees I lean the logs on so the bottom of
the log is not in contact iwth the ground.

### Signs things are progressing properly in that first year.

The spawn we use for inoculating the trees is mixture of mycelium growing throughout a sawdust
medium. When we first put it into drilled holes in the logs and cover it with wax it appears
to be a light brown.

The color of the spawn under the wax will change from medium brown to white in about two weeks of
warm weather and sufficient moisture. The change to white is the first indication sign of
mycelium growing happiness.

After another four weeks of good mycelium groing conditions white mycelium growth spots
will appear at ends of the logs. The first spots will appear in the invcoluationholes closest
to that end. Most of the cells in a log are oriented longitudinally and this cell orientation
makes growth in that direction easier.

### It's important to keep your logs someplace where you visit often.

When the mycelium in the logs starts a fruiting it usually only takes about 5-7 days for a tiny
button poking through the bark to grow into a full-sized mushroom! If you have your logs
someplace you only get to once every 3-4 weeks you could miss a fruiting entirely!

This is how fast they grow over just four days!
{% include youtubeplayer.html id="3-j1gR_BRjs" %}

If you can it's also helpful to have them someplace where it is possible to water them if
there ends up being a summer drought.

### Forcing a log to fruit

After a log has fruited for the first time you can force (encourage) a log to fruit by
exposing it to a temperature/moisture shock. Put the logs in a cold steam of a stock
tank filled with cold water for a day. Then take them out and lean them up. If the
mycelium was ready you will have a new fruiting ready to pick in a week.

After a log has fruited it's important to wait until the mycelium has again built up enough
biological energy for a subsequent fruiting. This usually means 7-8 weeks of good mycelium
growing weather: relatively warm and regular soaking rains (or the equivalent watering).

I force my logs by throwing them into the cold stream next to where I keep them for a day.

### What can you expect the second and subsequent years?

In the second year you can expect some logs to have larger fruitings with many mushrooms.

Here's a log that I picked over 40 mushrooms from in one fruiting.

![Many Shiitakes on one log]({{site.url}}/assets/images/mushrooms/many-shiitakes-on-one-log.jpg)

This level of abundance is unusual. Normally I might get 5-10 mushrooms on a single 
log in a fruiting.

### Drying Shiitakes.

Dried Shiitakes keep for months if you store them in a light and air-tight container.

I've used a small food dehydrator. Drying outside on a screen in sunny dry conditions works well too!

A good harvest ... and an abundance that makes the food dehydrator very useful.

### Supplies.

We've been buying our supplies from [fieldforest.net]](https://www.fieldforest.net).

1. Spawn: this is mycelium that has been grown on sterile sawdust. We buy five pound bags for $25-30.
2. Cheese wax. This is heated and used to seal the holes filled with mycelium spawn as well as to seal injuries in the bark of the log.
3. Special drill bit that works in an angle grinder. This bit make drilling just the right holes very fast an easy.
4. Angle grinder for use with the special drill bit.
5. Hot plate and pan for melting the cheese wax.
6. Extra catalogs and copies  of the excellent pamphlets Field and Forest supply with their spawn.

### Strains we have tried.

#### Wide range Shiitake strains.

- [WR46](https://www.fieldforest.net/Wide-Range-Strains/products/32/): a wide-range strain that will fruit from Spring through Fall. The mycelium develops relatively quickly (6-9months at 75 degrees until first fruiting and the logs recover quickly after the fruiting.
- [West Wind](https://www.fieldforest.net/Shiitake-West-Wind-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SWW/): West Wind features a fast spawn run, large, thick, first flush mushrooms, and heavy yields, making it a great strain choice for new growers. West Wind is also slightly more drought tolerant than other WR strains, and shows a slight preference for red oak over white oak. Fruits naturally in the spring and fall.
- [Beltane](https://www.fieldforest.net/Shiitake-Beltane-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SBT/): Beltane is named after the Celtic May Day, which celebrates the return of vitality to the growing season. This new strain prefers May weather for the heaviest seasonal fruiting, but produces quality mushrooms mid-summer in a cool, shaded woods after dunking in cold water. Firm, caramel-colored caps dusted with white fibrils darken to cocoa brown as caps flatten. Fruiting temp ranges from 54-75° F.
- [Native Harvest](https://www.fieldforest.net/Shiitake-Native-Harvest-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SNH/): naturalized on our farm several years ago, this strain has been tested from North to South and the results are the same: a very fast, vigorous strain with excellent quality. First found on oak, it is also a good producer on Red Maple. Unlike other wide range species, Native Harvest™ also gives a late fall flush; an added bonus for the Thanksgiving table! Spawn run is 6 to 12 months.

#### Warm wather Shiitake strains.

- [Night Velvet](https://www.fieldforest.net/Shiitake-Night-Velvet-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SNV/): a warm weather strain (that behaves more like a wide-range strain) that will fruit from mid-Spring to early-Fall. Typically the mycelium will take 9-12 months at 75 degrees to develop before the first fruitings. After the first fruiting both strains will respond well to "forcing" a fruiting by soaking the logs for a day in cold water.

#### Oyster strains.

- [PoHu](https://www.fieldforest.net/Oyster-PoHu-Pleurotus-ostreatus-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SPH/): this oyster strain is the most “wide range” of all our Oyster strains. Expect multiple fruitings throughout the growing season, including summer. PoHu is a heavy producer and grows many ocher to white colored mushrooms in thick clusters, perfect for farm markets and hungry homegrowers.
- [Kira](https://www.fieldforest.net/Oyster-Kira-Pleurotus-ostreatus-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SKR/): the Kira Oyster’s color moves from blue gray to nearly white, finishing with large dusky clusters of savory oysters. The hallmark of this strain is its ability to adapt to a wide range of wood types with multiple fruitings across the season. Most fruiting for this oyster occurs in the spring and fall, with a fruiting temp range of 40-60° F. Kira is like a cool weather version of PoHu with its prolific nature, and at F&FP, it’s the beloved oyster of spring.

#### Lions Mane

Fall 2017 Kathy Becker brough Beech logs and Lions Mane in plug form. Reports are that initial growth
before firts fruiting takes two years.
