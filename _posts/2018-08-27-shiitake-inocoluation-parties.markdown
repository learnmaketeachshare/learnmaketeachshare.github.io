## Inoculation parties early November and late March.

Forest Voges and I have been hosting community Shiitake Inoculation parties every Fall
and Spring for the last few years. We usually hold them behind Forest's house at
206 Cooleyville Rd,Shutesbury, MA 01072.

We supply materials, tools, and some assembly line systems  to help
the work move smoothly. We also have been cutting and collecting logs for inocolulation.

_Forest's Landrover filled with Red Oak logs for inoculation after collecting what we
earlier cut in the woods._

Folks are very welcome to join us and learn about log inoculation and to take home some logs.

If you want to bring logs to inoculate and share that's fantastic!

If you have trees that would make good Shiitake or Oyster logs and need help cutting and
moving them just let me know. We can help!

The cash outlay usually runs between $90-120 and we encourage people to contribute what
they can and what feels fair.

The first one was Nov 12, 2016 -- just after the presidential election. I think everybody
was enjoying doing something optimistic together.

We usually start around 10-11, have a pot luck lunch around 1, and finish around 3-4.

### Good logs for growing Shiitakes and when to cut them.

White Oak seems to be one of the very best trees for growing Shiitakes,
Red Oak is fine also. We've also grown them on Red Maple and Beech.

See this species selection table: [Tree Species Chart.pdf](https://www.fieldforest.net/pdfs/Tree%20Species%20Chart.pdf)

It's important to use trees that have a great deal of stored food energy. It's this stored
food energy that the mushroom mycelium processes and uses to intermittently create
fruiting bodies to spread spores. While most of the mushroom exists in the
form of a web of mycelium growing throughouut the log the visible fruiting bodies
are what we pick and what everybody refers to as mushrooms.

Deciduous trees have the least food energy in the late Spring and early summer. They have used up
a bunch of energy creating and growing lots of green leaves and it's these leaves which are
creating energy for the tree the rest of the sumer and into the Fall. When the leaves have
turned color in the Fall the tree is no longer making and storing additional food energy. This is a great
time to cut trees for mushroom inoculation. Around here that is usually in mid to late October.

Mushroom logs need to be moved around and re-positioned occasionally so it's helpful to make
sure they aren't too big and end up annoyingly heavy. A good size to cut are logs with
diameters from 3-6 inches and lengths from 28 to 36-40 inches. This usually means that a tree
that is 8 inches in diameter at the base is terrific.

After cutting, the logs need to rest for two or three weeks before inoculation. A healthy tree
has anti-fungal properties and it important to let these properties dissapate before introducing
the mushroom mycelium we want to grow in the log.

After cutting, the logs should be placed in low stacks just above the ground and protected from
drying out excessively. If they end up stacked where it's sunny cover them with something
to lessen the tendency to dry out. Take the covers off it it rains.

Another good time to cut logs is in the early Spring before the buds swell. Around
here that usually means mid-March. As this point the tree still hasn't used much of the
food energy stored last season.

### Good logs for growing Oysters.

Oyster mushrooms like to grow on some of the softer hardwoods.
Any of these species should work well:

1. Bigtooth Aspen (Populus grandidentata)
2. Trembling Aspen (Populus tremuloides)
3. Cottonwood (P. deltoides and other spp.)
4. Balsam Poplar (P. balsamifera and other spp.)
5. Basswood
6. Hackberry and Mulberry
7. Willows (Salix spp.)
8. Tulip or Yellow Poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera)

I've also seen uncultivated Oysters growing well on Sugar Maple and Beech logs.

### After inoculation it usually takes about a year before before first fruiting.

After inoculation the logs will usually need a full growing season before the mycelium
has built up enough energy to start a first fruiting. Mycelium grows best when the
weather is warmer and the logs stay relatively moist.

During this initial period keep the logs in low stacks just off the ground and someplace where
they get little direct sunlight.

1. Low stacks close to the ground help keep the logs moister because the microclimate next to the ground is a bit more humid.
2. Once established if the log drys out the mycelium won't die -- it will just stop growing. You'll get mushrooms sooner if the logs are kept relatively moist.

If you inoculated in the Fall or Spring and the summer has been warm and there were regular
soaking rains it's reasonable to expect a first fruiting to happen in the Fall. When you think
the logs might be getting ready to fruit stand them up and lean them against a tree or fence.

There are two problems to be aware of if the mushrooms start to fruit while the logs are
in a low stack.

1. You might not see them if they start growing on the bottoim of the log.
2. Some will end up growing into the side of the log next in the stack and end up mishapen.

It will be both easier to see and pick mushrooms that are fruiting when the logs are
almost upright and leaning against something.

Shiitake mycelium appear to still grow throughout a log even when other fungi are also colonizing
the log -- however it's good to avoid introducing other fungi.

_I've started placing flat rocks around the trees I lean the logs on so the bottom of the log is not in contact with the ground._
![standing logs on rocks]({{site.url}}/assets/images/mushrooms/standing-logs-on-rocks.jpg)

### Signs things are progressing properly in the first year after inoculation.

Mushroom spawn is made by growing a specific strain of mycelium in a sterile sawdust medium.
We usually buy spawn in 5 pound bags just before the inoculation party.

When spawn is first put into drilled holes and covered with
wax it appears to be a medium-light brown color.

The color of the spawn under the wax will change to white in about two weeks of
warm weather and sufficient moisture. The change to white is the first indication of
mycelium growing happiness.

After another four weeks of good mycelium growing conditions white spots of mycelium growth
will appear at ends of the logs.

The first spots will appear lined up with the inoculation holes closest to that end.
Most of the cells in a log are oriented longitudinally and this cell orientation
makes growth in that direction easier.

_After another couple of months the white spots of mycelium on the ends of the logs will be getting much larger._
![White mycelium spots after four months]({{site.url}}/assets/images/mushrooms/after-four-months.jpg)

### It's important to keep your logs someplace where you visit often.

When the mycelium in the logs starts a fruiting it usually only takes about 5-7 days for a tiny
button poking through the bark to grow into a full-sized mushroom! If you have your logs
deep in the woods and you only get to visit once every 3-4 weeks you could miss a fruiting entirely!

_This is how fast a little Shiitake grows over just four days!_
{% include youtubeplayer.html id="3-j1gR_BRjs" %}

It's helpful to be able to water your logs if the weather ends up hot and dry and
there is no rain for several weeks.

### Forcing a log to fruit

After a log has fruited for the first time and then after the mycelium has grown and
stored enough new energy reserves you can encourage a log to start a fruiting by
exposing it to a temperature and moisture shock.

My logs are stacked next to a cold steam with regular flow so I just throw them
into the stream for a day. When the flow is high I made a temorary boom out of rope
chunks of Black Birch to keep the floating logs from washing downstream.

_Using a temporary homemade boom to keep logs from floating away in periods of high flow._
![Using a homemade boom to keep logs from floating away]({{site.url}}/assets/images/mushrooms/using-a-homemade-boom-to-keep-logs-from-floating-away.jpg)

If you don't have a stream you can use a stock tank or even a large trash can. The
fruiting response of the mycelium is enhanced if the water is much colder than the
air temperature. This will be true just after a soaking tank is filled with water
that is basically ground temperature. After just a day or two the water will be close
to the existing average air temperature and will need to be emptied and refilled to
get more cold water.

If the mycelium was ready to fruit you should have a new crop of mushrooms ready to pick in a week.

After a log has fruited it's important to wait until the mycelium has again built up enough
biological energy for a subsequent fruiting. This usually means 7-8 weeks of good mycelium
growing weather: relatively warm and regular soaking rains (or the equivalent watering).

### What can you expect during the second and subsequent years after inoculation?

In the second year you can expect some logs to have larger fruitings with many mushrooms.

_Here's a log that I picked over 40 mushrooms from in one fruiting._
![Many Shiitakes on one log]({{site.url}}/assets/images/mushrooms/many-shiitakes-on-one-log.jpg)

This level of abundance is unusual. Normally I might get 5-10 mushrooms on a single
log in a fruiting.

Normally Shiitake logs will produce significant numbers of mushrooms for at least 3-5 years.

### Drying Shiitakes.

Dried Shiitakes keep for months if you store them in a light and air-tight container.

I've used a small food dehydrator. Drying outside on a screen in sunny dry conditions works well too!

_A good harvest ... and an abundance that makes the food dehydrator very useful._

### Tools and supplies.

We've been buying our supplies from [fieldforest.net](https://www.fieldforest.net).

1. Spawn: this is mycelium that has been grown on sterile sawdust. We buy five pound bags for $25-30.
2. Cheese wax. This is heated and used to seal the holes filled with mycelium spawn as well as to seal injuries in the bark of the log.
3. Special drill bit that works in an angle grinder. This bit make drilling just the right holes very fast an easy.
4. Angle grinder for use with the special drill bit.
5. Hot plate and pan for melting the cheese wax.
6. Extra catalogs and copies  of the excellent pamphlets Field and Forest supply with their spawn.

### Strains we have tried.

#### Wide range Shiitake strains.

- [WR46](https://www.fieldforest.net/Wide-Range-Strains/products/32/): a wide-range strain that will fruit from Spring through Fall. The mycelium develops relatively quickly (6-9months at 75 degrees until first fruiting and the logs recover quickly after the fruiting.
  ![Large W46 Shiitake]({{site.url}}/assets/images/mushrooms/large-w46-shiitake.jpg)
- [West Wind](https://www.fieldforest.net/Shiitake-West-Wind-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SWW/): West Wind features a fast spawn run, large, thick, first flush mushrooms, and heavy yields, making it a great strain choice for new growers. West Wind is also slightly more drought tolerant than other WR strains, and shows a slight preference for red oak over white oak. Fruits naturally in the spring and fall.
- [Beltane](https://www.fieldforest.net/Shiitake-Beltane-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SBT/): Beltane is named after the Celtic May Day, which celebrates the return of vitality to the growing season. This new strain prefers May weather for the heaviest seasonal fruiting, but produces quality mushrooms mid-summer in a cool, shaded woods after dunking in cold water. Firm, caramel-colored caps dusted with white fibrils darken to cocoa brown as caps flatten. Fruiting temp ranges from 54-75° F.
- [Native Harvest](https://www.fieldforest.net/Shiitake-Native-Harvest-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SNH/): naturalized on our farm several years ago, this strain has been tested from North to South and the results are the same: a very fast, vigorous strain with excellent quality. First found on oak, it is also a good producer on Red Maple. Unlike other wide range species, Native Harvest™ also gives a late fall flush; an added bonus for the Thanksgiving table! Spawn run is 6 to 12 months.

#### Warm wather Shiitake strains.

- [Night Velvet](https://www.fieldforest.net/Shiitake-Night-Velvet-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SNV/): a warm weather strain (that behaves more like a wide-range strain) that will fruit from mid-Spring to early-Fall. Typically the mycelium will take 9-12 months at 75 degrees to develop before the first fruitings. After the first fruiting both strains will respond well to "forcing" a fruiting by soaking the logs for a day in cold water.

#### Oyster strains.

- [PoHu](https://www.fieldforest.net/Oyster-PoHu-Pleurotus-ostreatus-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SPH/): this oyster strain is the most “wide range” of all our Oyster strains. Expect multiple fruitings throughout the growing season, including summer. PoHu is a heavy producer and grows many ocher to white colored mushrooms in thick clusters, perfect for farm markets and hungry homegrowers.
  ![PoHu Oyster mushroom]({{site.url}}/assets/images/mushrooms/pohu-oyster-mushroom.jpg)
- [Kira](https://www.fieldforest.net/Oyster-Kira-Pleurotus-ostreatus-Sawdust-Spawn/productinfo/SKR/): the Kira Oyster’s color moves from blue gray to nearly white, finishing with large dusky clusters of savory oysters. The hallmark of this strain is its ability to adapt to a wide range of wood types with multiple fruitings across the season. Most fruiting for this oyster occurs in the spring and fall, with a fruiting temp range of 40-60° F. Kira is like a cool weather version of PoHu with its prolific nature, and at F&FP, it’s the beloved oyster of spring.

#### Lions Mane

Fall 2017 Kathy Becker brought Beech logs and Lions Mane in plug form to share. She reports that we should expect the initial mycelium growth before first fruiting to take about two years.
