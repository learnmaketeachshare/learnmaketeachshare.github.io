For me the phrase "Learn Make Teach Share" represents both an ethic and a practice that
helps weave more curiousity and kindness into our interactions with each other.

I greatly enjoy making all sorts of things both beautiful and utilitarian but
my peak experiences have all come helping to create/inspire that deep full-body
smile people get when they figure out something they never knew they could do
before.

I believe those ripples of curiousity and joy make self-reinforcing waves that can help
make the world more wonderful.
