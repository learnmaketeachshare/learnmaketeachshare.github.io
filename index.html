        </h3><p>The pandemic arrived in March 2020 and I wanted to do something to help. I saw lots of folks were sewing masks locally for hospitals and first responders and they were being made either without nose strips to help shape and seal the mask where it fits over a persons nose or adapting household items that might not be stiff enough to keep the shape like twist ties or pipe cleaners.</p>

There are some interesting intonation issues I am investigating that I suspect are inherently more difficult to ameliorate because the tops have been designed to work very efficiently with lightweight steel strings.</p>

TERC is a 501-C3 educational non-profit focused on math and science education and research and Ronald Reagan drastically cut back the Department of Education. For an organization that relied on soft money this was a big problem. Our grant funding was drying up.</p>

I was doing this with a small group mentored by a good friend John Fabel. Since I already had experience making all kinds of things I also ended up making many tools and making tools to make tools.</p>
